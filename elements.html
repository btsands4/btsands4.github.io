										<h3 class="major">Databases Project</h3>
										<p>My Databases project was a semester long project where I was apart of a team of five members. Every month we had to submit a milestone as a check up on our progress. The first milestone consisted of creating our ERD for our project. The second milestone focused on creating relations based on our ERD. The third milestone challenged us to convert our relations into the actual database and program the data within the database. We were able to generate dummy data that allowed us to process the information for our company. We were able to create queries for the Elysian Fly Fishing Company so they could access key information for themselves. Some of the issues we helped them resolve included being able to calculate their highest selling products and which ones product the greatest profit margins.</p>
										<p>View our ERD!</p>

										<h3 class="major">Tic-Tac-Toe WPF</h3>
										<p> This Tic-Tac-Toe assignment required using WPF to be able to play a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game required each cell to be associated with a button that allowed the user to click it to become an X or an O. When there was a winner, the program could determine that someone won. When the game finished, it could ask the user if they wanted to play again or not. There was also a scoreboard that could calculate how many times X and O had won. The game had a menu at the top that used JSON. When the user clicked on the rules, a new WPF application would open that imported data from a Tic-Tac-Toe rules website to explain the rules for the game. </p>

										<h3 class="major">HTML and CSS Project</h3>
										<p> The HTML & CSS assignment required creating a HTML and CSS file to follow the guidelines gives based on the assignment. I was able to receive a 100% on this assigment by striclty following the professor's guidelines. I had to use several important CSS functions including padding, float, margin, display, text-decoration, color, box-shadow, and span.</p>
