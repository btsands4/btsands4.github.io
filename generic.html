As mentioned above, my name is Ben Sands. I am originally from Tulsa, Oklahoma where I graduated from Bishop Kelley High School in May of 2017. I began my college experience in the Fall of 2017 at the University of Oklahoma. I originally came to OU as a Business Undecided major. I decided to double major in Management Information Systems and Marketing. I chose MIS because I liked the analytical and technical skills associated with it, and I chose to pair it with Marketing because I liked the communication and buyer behavior aspect. I believe both of these majors will prepare me for a career within the IT field as they focus on technical and personal skills. I hope to work as a Project Manager or Systems Analyst in the future. I believe these career fields best fit my strengths because I have an analytical brain, but I love to work with others in a team. I believe my leadership experience in college will prepare me to be a great team worker in any corporate job that I may have.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Professional Experience</h3>
									<p>I have taken over 90 hours at the University of Oklahoma. Some of my favorite courses include Intro to Programming, Databases, Public Speaking, and Marketing Research. I have been able to get involved within the Management Information Systems Student Association which has allowed me to connect with other students in my major and create strong friendships. I am excited to announce that I plan to intern with OneGas in Tulsa for the Summer of 2021. I am very excited for this internship as it will allow me to equip the skills that I have learned in my courses to real life application. I believe this internship will prepare me for a career when the Information Technology department of any company.</p>



									<h3 class="major">Campus Involvement</h3>
									<p>While serving as a student at OU, I have been able to get very involved on campus. Some of the organizations that I have been apart of are University Sing, MISSA, LEAD Team, and Pi Kappa Alpha. Each of these has helped me to grow my leadership skills and learn how to work effectively in a team.</p>
									<p> My proudest accomplishment has been serving as the University Sing Chair. University Sing is one of the most sacred traditions at OU where student groups pair together each year to create a mini Broadway style musical. My duties as chair included balancing a $25,000 budget, leading a 60 person executive committee, and working with 6 vice chairs year round to plan the event. However, the COVID-19 pandemic struck and shook up our whole event. We were able to keep University Sing alive by holding the showing at the Winchester Drive-In in Oklahoma City. Each casts performance was filmed and edited together on the big screen. Serving as Chair required adaptability and leadership over so much uncertainty. I am so proud to say that we were able to still hold University Sing. You can watch the live stream for our event on the link below!</p>
